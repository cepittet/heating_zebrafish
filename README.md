# *her* mutants sensitivity to heatshock in the zebrafish

This small repository plots severity rating matrices following heatshocks conducted on zebrafish *her* mutants.

## Mutants
- DMD homozygous (control)
- DMD/her1
- DMD/her7
- DMD/loop her1
## Conditions
- Control (no heatshock)
- 35°C heatshock
- 37°C heatshock
- 39°C heatshock
## Plots
- Barplot of the average severity rating, for each condition and line
- Lineplots of the average severity rating by segment, for each condition and line
